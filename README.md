### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

Term: Fall 2023

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app using one of **the OpenFEMA data sets** of your choice. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

##  Exploring Property Actions & Funding in Hazard Mitigation Projects in the US
Term: Fall 2023

	+ Spardha Sharma (ss6343)
	+ Daniel Thomas Luce (dtl2129)

+ **Project summary**: We examined data from the [Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hazard-mitigation-assistance-projects-v3) & [Hazard Mitigation Assistance Mitigated Properties](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hazard-mitigation-assistance-mitigated-properties-v3) datasets. Our objective was to learn about the property actions taken in the US hazard mitigation projects. We looked at how these actions vary based on the type of hazard (floods/earthquakes/etc.), property foundation (slab on grade/elevation/etc.) and housing structure (residential/commercial/etc.). Additionally, we analyzed funding trends over the years and predicted future changes in the number of projects. We also conducted a detailed state-wise analysis to gain localized insights. Our analysis aims to answer the following questions:-

  +  How do property actions differ for various mitigation programs? 
  + How do building structure types differ for various mitigation programs?
  + How do foundation types differ for various mitigation programs?
  + Which states have received the most funding on mitigation programs?
  + How has the average actual amount amount paid to the property owner for mitigation efforts changed over the years?
  + How will the number of mitigation projects change over the next 3 years?
  + How does the number of mitigation programs vary across different states?
  + How does the number of mitigation programs vary across different counties?
  + How has the number of mitigation programs changed over the years?
  + How are property actions distributed?

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
