# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Data Folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The 'HazardMitigationAssistanceMitigatedProperties_cleaned.csv' and 'HazardMitigationAssistanceProjects(cleaned).csv' are two datasets from the OpenFEMA data sets, and have been cleaned.
