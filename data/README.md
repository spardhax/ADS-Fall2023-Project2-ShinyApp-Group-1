### Data Folder

The data directory contains data that was used in the analysis. These will be treated as read only, more specifically the R/python files which are never allowed to write to files located here.

The 'HazardMitigationAssistanceMitigatedProperties_cleaned.csv' and 'HazardMitigationAssistanceProjects(cleaned).csv' are two datasets from the OpenFEMA data sets, and  they have been cleaned for our use.
